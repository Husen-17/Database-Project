# Database-Project
"Ageless Museum": a novel database design for a new museum. It tracks entities, facilitates visitor tracking, collects data for analysis, and ensures secure archival. With streamlined processes and effective communication, it enhances museum management and visitor experiences.
“A Database Design for 
Ageless Museum”, through which we aim to design a novel database for a newly established museum so 
various entities, such as employees and art pieces, are easily tracked by the Database Administrator 
(DBA). This database also helps naive, or parametric, users at the entrance of the museum easily track the 
visits of all the customers who can optionally provide feedback through the organized feedback program.
Sophisticated users also benefit from this database design as it facilitates the collection and aggregation of 
data regarding the visitors and their interests as well as statistics that reveal which sections or departments 
attract the greatest amount of donations or revenue.
This database design not only aims to facilitate communication across the numerous aspects of this 
museum, but to securely archive these records as well. The different constraints set by this design 
contribute to limiting potential errors and mistakes related to data entry so the data aggregation process is 
more streamlined.
Sections II and III discuss the copyrights related to this project and the tools utilized throughout this phase 
of the project, respectively. The following section (IV) describes the system and its corresponding 
constraints after which a detailed illustration of the notations used is represented in the form of a legend 
based on the Peter-Chen notation (section V). A complete visualization of the ER Model for this database 
is then clearly depicted in section VI reflecting the logical design of this database. A detailed explanation 
of the entities, their respective attributes, and the relationships among them is, then, stated throughout 
sections VII and VIII respectively. Section IX of this report discusses the mapping process of the 
established ER diagram into relations based on a 7-step algorithm, as discussed in the 7th edition of the 
Fundamentals of Database Systems (Elmasri, R. & Navathe, S. B.) book, which is then reflected in 
section X, providing a comprehensive overview of all relations. Sections XI, XII, and XIII represent the 
implementation of the database on Oracle DBMS using SQL, including creating the tables, inserting data
(forming a sample database state), and querying the database respectively. Section XIV then deals with 
normalizing, or decomposing, relations to meet the standards of all normal forms ranging from the first 
normal form to the Boyce-Codd normal form.
